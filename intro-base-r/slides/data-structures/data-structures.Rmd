# Motivation

.big-text-font[
- Going back to the **storage** problem: how do we store data in a format that R recognizes

- **Data types** allow us to group related data

- **Data structures** provide an interface to 
organize, manage, and store our data.

- The data types and data structures define how we interact with data

- Many programming problems occur because of incompatible data types and data structures so mastery of this section is important 
]

---

## Goals moving forward:
.big-text-font[
- Introduce fundamental data types and data structures
- Build up to the `data frame` data structure
- Recognize the relationship between the different data structures
]

---

# Numerical variables

.big-text-font[
- We can divide data into two big types: numerical and categorical
- **Numerical** variables contain data of numerical values
- **Numerical** variables can be further divided into **continuous** and **discrete** numerical variables
- **Continuous numerical** variables take on the full range of numerical values where as **discrete numerical** variables have jumps in numerical values
- **Continuous** examples: price, weight, miles ran
- **Discrete** examples: number of people in store, number of cars sold, number of likes 
]

---

# Categorical variables

.big-text-font[
- **Categorical** variables contain data of two or more categories
- **Categorical** variables can be further divided into **nominal** and **ordinal** numerical variables
- **Ordinal categorical** variables have some natural ordering to the categories where as **nominal categorical** variables have no such ordering (ie: Alabama, Texas, New York)
- **Ordinal examples**: {elementary, middle, high school}, {low, medium, high}, {strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree}
- **Nominal examples**: hair color, transportation method, social media platform

.center[
`r knitr::asis_output(paste(readLines(data_types_table_path), collapse = '\n'))`
]

---

# Checking object type

.big-text-font[
- Check the type of an object with the `typeof()` function.
]

<br>  

.code-bg[
```{r data-types, collapse = TRUE}
typeof(1L)
typeof(1.5)
typeof("hello")
typeof(TRUE)
typeof(NULL)
```
]

---

# Special values: NA

.big-text-font[
- There are two special values to be aware of in R: `NA` and `NaN`

- `NA` indicates a missing value

- `NA`'s "propagates" when doing performing operations with `NA`

- Many functions have common argument `na.rm=TRUE` to remove `NA` before performing operation

- Check if a value is NA with `is.na()` - will be very useful!
]

---

# Special values: NA

.code-bg[
```{r NA, collapse=TRUE}
# NA propagation
1 + NA
NA * 5

# NA is removed so x = c(0,1,2,3,4)
# then, the mean is computed
mean(x = c(0,1,2,3,4,NA), na.rm = TRUE)

# check if something is NA
is.na(NA)
```
]

---

# Special values: NaN

.big-text-font[
- `NaN` indicates an invalid math operation (ie: divide by 0, subtract by infinity)
- Check if a value is `NaN` with `is.nan()`
]

.code-bg[
```{r NaN, collapse=TRUE}
# examples where NaN can occur
sqrt(-1)
0/0
Inf - Inf

# Check if something is NaN
is.nan(NaN)
```
]

---

# Vectors

.big-text-font[
**vector**: a sequence of values where each value must be of the same type

- Vectors are objects

- Vectors are everywhere!

- Vectors are the building blocks of other data structures

- We can create a vector of each data types: `integer`, `double`, `character`, `logical`
]

---

# Vector mental model

.center[
![Vectors](images/vector.png)
]

--- 

# Vectors in R

- Create vectors with the `c()` function. Separate values with a comma
- The c stands for combine.
- Check that an object is a vector with `is.vector()`

.code-bg[
```{r vectors, collapse=TRUE}
# note the L after the integer
integer_vector <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
typeof(integer_vector)

double_vector <- c(1L, 2.5, 3/7)
typeof(double_vector)

# notice the capitalization
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
typeof(logical_vector)

character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
typeof(character_vector)

# check if it's a vector - outputs true or false
is.vector(character_vector)
```
]

---

# Factors

.big-text-font[
- Factors are a special type of vectors that have a fixed and known set of values
- Use factor variables when you know the variable will have a fixed set of values
- Create a factor with `factor()`.
- The levels of a factor are the unique set of values in the factor
- The labels of a factor are labels for the levels in the factor
]

---

# Creating a factor

.code-bg[
```{r factors, collapse=TRUE}
states <- c("California", "CA", "Cali", 
            "Texas", "TX", "Texas",
            "Oregon", "Oregon", "Oregan") 
states

# notice how the levels are unique
# length of levels shoud be same as labels
states_factor <- 
  factor(states,
         levels = c("California", "CA", "Cali", 
                    "Texas", "TX", 
                    "Oregon", "Oregan"),
         labels = c("CA", "CA", "CA",
                    "TX", "TX",
                    "OR", "OR")
  )
states_factor         
```
]

---

# Vector structure

### Element names

.big-text-font[
- Each element of a vector can be assigned a name as well. Call this the **element name** to distinguish from **name**
- A typical use case for this is to label a numerical value with informative text
]

### Indices

.big-text-font[
- The **indices** give the position of an element
- Indices are integers that always start at 1 and increment by 1 to the length of the vector

# Detailed Vector mental model

# Setting element names

.big-text-font[
- Set and access element names for a vector with the `names()` function.
- Note that the element names of a vector is another vector.
]

.code-bg[
```{r vector-names1, collapse=TRUE}
month_days <- c(31, 28, 31, 30, 31)
month_days

# set element names
names(month_days) <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May")
names(month_days)

# note the element names associated with each element now
month_days

# names(month_days) is a vector
is.vector(names(month_days))
```
]

---

# Setting element names

.big-text-font[
- Alternatively, specify a `name = value` pair when you create the vector   
]

.code-bg[
```{r vector-names2, collapse=TRUE}
month_days <- c("Jan" = 31, 
                "Feb" = 28, 
                "Mar" = 31, 
                "Apr" = 30, 
                "May" = 31)
month_days

# names(month_days) is a vector
is.vector(names(month_days))
```
]

---

# Useful functions for vectors

.big-text-font[
- Many functions expect a vector as an argument.
]

.code-bg[
```{r vector-functions, collapse = TRUE}
x <- c(-2, 0, 2, 4)

# compute sum of all elements in a vector
sum(x)
# compute mean of all elements in a vector
mean(x)
# compute standard devation of all elements in a vector
sd(x)
# get minimum value in a vector
min(x)
# get minimum value in a vector
max(x)
# get the length of a vector
length(x)
```
]

---

# Useful functions for vectors ...

- `seq()` generates a sequence of values
- `rep` repeats elements in a vector

.code-bg[
```{r more-vector-functions, collapse = TRUE}
# use the colon to get a sequence of numbers
x <- c(1:10)
x

# or use seq() for more flexibility
a <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
a

y_alternate <- rep(x = c(1,2), times = 5)
y_alternate

y_element_wise <- rep(x = c(1,2), each = 5)
y_element_wise

y_same_length <- rep(x = c(1,2), length.out = 5)
y_same_length

```
]

---

# Vector Operations

- Arithmetic (`+, -, *, /`) is done element-wise with vectors.

## Code Example
.code-bg[
```{r vector-operations, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(1, 4, 9)

x + y

y - x

x * y

y / x
```
]

- When vectors are the same length (have the same number of elements), arithmetic is intuitive.

---

# Vectorized operations

.big-text-font[
- Element-wise operations are also called **vectorized** operations
- The idea is that I don't need to explicitly specify an operation on each element of a vector - the operation is applied to each element
- **Vectorized** operations simplify our code
]

### Example - Square root

.code-bg[
```{r vectorization, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 4, 9, 16, 25)
x

sqrt(x)
```
]

---

# Vectorized operations

.big-text-font[
- *Vectorized* operations will save us a lot of time and effort when our operations become complex
]

### Without vectorized operations
.code-bg[
```{r without-vectorization, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 4, 9, 16, 25)
n <- length(x)
result <- rep(NA_integer_, n) 
for (i in seq_len(n)) {
  result[i] <- x[i] ^ (1/2)
}
result
```
]


---

# Vector Recycling

.big-text-font[
- It turns out that you can perform vector operations on vectors of unequal length
- R deals with unequal length by "recycling" the shorter vector to the length of the longer vector
]

## Code Example

.code-bg[
```{r vector-recycling, collapse = TRUE}
# note: x is a vector - a length one vector!
x <- 5
y <- c(1, 2, 3)

# behind the scenes, R recycles the value 5 until the
# vector x looks like this: c(5, 5, 5)
# then, it is the usual element-wise operation
x * y

x + y
```
]

---

# Vector Recycling

- In theory, vector recycling can work when you have any pairs of varying vector lengths.
- But, the behavior is hard to predict and keep track of. 
- I suggest to stick with the case where *one vector is length 1 and the other vector is some arbitrary length*

## Code Example
.code-bg[
```{r vector-recycling2, collapse = TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

# x becomes: c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1)
# so x + y = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1) + c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
x + y
```
]

- Notice the warning - it's encouraging us to try to keep the longer vector a multiple of the shorter vector 

---

# Type Coercion

- Recall that all elements in a vector must be of the same type
- If we try to circumvent this property, R converts all elements to the same type through **coercion**. 

.code-bg[
```{r vector-coercion1, collapse = TRUE}
# integer and double
x <- c(1L, 2.3)
x
typeof(x)

# character and double
y <- c("1", 1)
y
typeof(y)

# double and logical
z <- c(1, TRUE)
z
typeof(z)
```
]

---

# Type Coercion Rule

.big-text-font[
- One rule summarizes what happens when combining different types
]

.center[
**Type Coercion rule:** character → double → integer → logical
]

.big-text-font[
- Types downstream on the chain are converted to the highest type on the chain
]

---

# Type Coercion Rule

.big-text-font[
- Notice that the most general type (`character`) takes precedence - the character type can sensibly represent data of the `double`, `integer`, or `logical` class
]

.code-bg[
```{r character-type, eval = FALSE}
# character
"uci"
# double as character
"1.5"
# integer as character
"1"
# logical as character
"TRUE"
```
]

---

# Caution for Type Coercion

.big-text-font[
- Be mindful of type coercion - it may happen silently without your awareness
]

### Common situations where type coercion can occur 

.big-text-font[
- You use data from multiple sources - certain variables may be stored differently

- Some functions may need to convert to a specific type to perform some task
]

---

# Why use a vector?

.big-text-font[
- *Consistency*: data is all of the same type; allowable operations are defined accordingly

- For example, how is arithmetic defined for vectors with a mix of character and numeric values?

- Enforcing homogeneous type will make our code more predictable and manageable

# Lists

.big-text-font[
- **list**: a sequence of values where each value can have different types

- Lists are objects

- Lists are the most flexible data structure

- Think of lists as generalizations of vectors
    - **Vectors** hold *homogeneous* data
    - **Lists** hold *heterogeneous* data
    
- Since lists are more general and heterogeneous, it is harder to classify them like with vectors
]

---

# List mental model

.center[
![Lists](images/list.png)
]

---

# Lists in R

- Create lists with the `list()` function. Separate values with a comma
- Check that an object is a list with `is.list()`
- Just like with vectors, we can name each element of a list with `names()`

.code-bg[
```{r lists, collapse=TRUE}
my_list <- list(1L, "hello", TRUE, 1.5)
my_list

# names(my_list) is still a vector
names(my_list) <- c("integer", "character", "logical", "double")
names(my_list)
```
]

---

# Why use a list?

.question-text-font[
A. Lists can hold heterogeneous data

B. You want to process a group of related data

# Matrices

.big-text-font[
- **matrix**: a 2-dimensional rectangular table of values where every value must be the same type

- Matrices are objects

- Matrices hold **homogeneous** data

- Commonly, you use matrices with numbers

- Every row and column in a matrix is a vector
    
- Since we are in 2D, we use **rows** and **columns** to index a matrix
]

---

# Matrix mental model

![Matrix](images/matrix.png)

---

# Matrices in R

- Create a matrix with the `matrix()` function
- For a matrix, we need to provide some data to fill the matrix
- Check that an object is a matrix with `is.matrix()`

Let's create a `3 x 5` matrix and populate with values from 1 to 15.
.code-bg[
```{r matrix, collapse=TRUE}
# recall the colon shortcut to create a sequence of numbers
x <- c(1:15)
x

# with the vector x, create a matrix with 3 rows and 5 columns
m <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 3, ncol = 5)

# notice how the values are filled up
m
```
]

---

# Specify how values are filled in matrices

- Note how the values are filled with `matrix()`
- Add `byrow=TRUE` as an argument to `matrix()` to fill the values by row. The default is to fill by column

.code-bg[
```{r matrix-by-column, collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(1:15)
# note how I don't need to specify byrow=FALSE
m_by_column <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
m_by_row <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 3, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)

# values filled by column
m_by_column
# values filled by row
m_by_row
```

# Matrix row names and column names 

.big-text-font[
- Set and view the row names with `rownames()`
- Set and view the column names  with `colnames()`
- View both row names and column names with `dimnames()`
- Alternatively, set dimension names when creating the matrix
]

- Data frames are objects

- Data frame columns hold **homogeneous** data
